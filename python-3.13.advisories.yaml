      - CVE-2007-4559
      - GHSA-gw9q-c7gh-j9vm

          note: Upon further investigation, we have determined that this is not a security issue in the Python package itself. It's still possible to misuse the Python standard library, such as by supplying untrusted data to the tar extraction functions, in which case a vulnerability should be identified in the caller code.
